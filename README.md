## About ##

This project is a test automation framework using Selenium WebDriver and Mocha test runner. The project uses the Page Object Model design pattern to organize the web pages into separate classes. The `loginPage.js` and `inventoryPage.js` files contain methods for interacting with the login and inventory pages, respectively of the saucedemo UI. The `inventoryPageTests.js` file contains test cases for verifying the functionality of the inventory page. The project also uses `log4js` logging library to provide detailed logs of test execution. The `package.json` file lists the project dependencies, including Selenium WebDriver, Mocha, and `log4js`. The tests can be run with `npx mocha`.

f.e using running this command from the root directory of the project (`selenium-framework`) --> `npx mocha .\test\saucedemoTests\inventoryPageTests.js ` 
   - should run the `inventoryPageTests` and if any of the tests `PASS or FAIL`, the logs should be updated for this test under the `logs` directory
   - currently  **`only the inventoryPageTests is set up with log4js`**

## Requirements ##

Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have an account (you most likely do if you are reading this) for [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (npm automatically comes installed along with it).

<br>
<br>

## How to Start ##

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/NedEagle/selenium-framework

# Access said project, cd into root directory
$ cd selenium-framework

# Check that you have yarn installed on system
$ yarn --version

# If you don't have yarn installed use this npm command
$ npm install -g yarn

# Install dependencies - this should install all dependencies (required) listed in the package.json
$ yarn

# Run the tests (not headless browser by default)
$ npx mocha .\test\saucedemoTests\inventoryPageTests.js
```
